This is a script to query the three pools in the GammaSwap LP performance analysis (weETH-USDC, WETH-USDC and PENDLE-USDC)

You can analyze other pools by putting the GammaPool address in as the pool_id and by adding the pool creation date to the start_timestamp (or whatever arbitrary date you would like to start the analysis from)
